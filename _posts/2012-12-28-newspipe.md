### newspipe

Newspipe started out as a side project for collecting news articles. Now it is a complete ecosystem for training and deploying GPT-2. It includes many comprehensive tools, which you can use for many other use cases too. Following are the highlights of the whole newspipe ecosystem:
- [newspipe](https://github.com/NewsPipe/newspipe/newspipe): A scalable generic news article crawling and information extracting system built on top of Apache-Airflow, BeautifulSoup4 and newspaper3. You can manage your job with the built in dashboard, run the whole system on a Celery cluster and add news sources by just simply providing a link to the RSS feed or website.
- [wikidump](https://github.com/NewsPipe/wikidump): A CLI for downloading wikipedia articles in any language as json format
- [gpt2-tfx-pipeline](https://github.com/NewsPipe/gpt2-tfx-pipeline): A complete end-end pipeline for GPT-2. It includes training from scatch and finetuning from the OpenAI trained models. Training can be monitored with Tensorboard and models can be pushed automatically to a MLFlow model regristy
- [mlflow-heroku](https://github.com/NewsPipe/mlflow-heroku): The complete code for running a encrypted MLFlow server for tracking your models and experiments on heroku. This code also can be used on any provider you want.
