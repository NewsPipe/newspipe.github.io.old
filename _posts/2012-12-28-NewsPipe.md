Newspipe started out as a side project for collecting news articles. Now it is a complete ecosystem for training and deploying GPT-2. It includes many comprehensive tools, which you can use for many other use cases too. Following are the highlights of the whole newspipe ecosystem:
- [newspipe](https://github.com/NewsPipe/newspipe/newspipe): A scalable generic news article crawling and information extracting system built on top of Apache-Airflow, BeautifulSoup4 and newspaper3. You can manage your job with the built in dashboard, run the whole system on a Celery cluster and add news sources by just simply providing a link to the RSS feed or website.
- [wikidump](https://github.com/NewsPipe/wikidump): A CLI for downloading wikipedia articles in any language as json format
- [gpt2-tfx-pipeline](https://github.com/NewsPipe/gpt2-tfx-pipeline): A complete end-end pipeline for GPT-2 based on Googles framework TensorflowExtended. It includes training from scatch and finetuning from the OpenAI trained models. The data can be loaded from a MongoDB or a file on your local file system. This can also be extended to any data source you need. Training can then be monitored with Tensorboard and trained models can be pushed automatically to a MLFlow model regristy.
- [mlflow-heroku](https://github.com/NewsPipe/mlflow-heroku): The complete code for running a encrypted MLFlow server for tracking your models and experiments on heroku. This code also can be used on any provider you want.
